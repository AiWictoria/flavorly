# Flavorly

**Flavorly** is a user-friendly recipe application created as a school project.  
The goal is to provide an easy way to create, share and manage personal recipes.

The project is built entirely with **React** for frontend and **Minimal API** for backend.  
This makes the solution fast, lightweight, and simple to run in a single environment.
