# Flavorly

**Flavorly** is a user-friendly recipe application created as a school project.  
The goal is to provide an easy way to create, share and manage personal recipes.  

The project is built entirely with **React** for frontend and **Minimal API** for backend.  
This makes the solution fast, lightweight, and simple to run in a single environment.

---

## Purpose
Flavorly was developed as part of a school assignment to demonstrate a fullstack web application.  
It focuses on:
- CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Authentication and protected routes
- Data handling through Minimal API
- Modern UI with reusable components
- Fully responsive webapp

---

##  Features
- 👩‍🍳 Create, edit, and delete recipes  
- 🔎 Search, sort, and filter recipes  
- ❤️ Save favorite recipes  
- 💬 Add comments and ratings  
- 🛒 Manage a personal shopping list (add, remove, check items)  
- 🔐 Login and protected pages

---

## Tech Stack
- **React Rapide** – frontend (Routing) + backend (Minimal API)  
- Custom reusable hooks (`useRecipes`, `useAuth`, `useShoppingList`)  
- **react-hot-toast** – feedback notifications  
- **React Bootstrap** + custom **SCSS** and **Bootstrap** for styling
